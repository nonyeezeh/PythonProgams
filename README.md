### Introduction
Welcome to my Python Playground!

This GitHub repository features a variety of small Python programs, including classic games like Rock, Paper, Scissors, and practical tools such as password generators. It's a showcase of my creativity, problem-solving, and Python skills.

Feel free to explore, learn, and have fun with the code. Updates and new additions are on the way, so stay tuned for more! üöÄüêç

### pyGuessingGame
A Mini Guessing Game üêç

#### Overview
The Mini Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Python program that offers a great opportunity for beginners to learn the basics of programming. In this tiny game, users are given 5 chances to guess the correct number between 1 and 10. While the game itself is straightforward, the code behind it serves as an excellent learning resource for those new to Python and programming in general.

#### Concepts
By exploring the code for the Mini Guessing Game, beginners can familiarize themselves with fundamental Python concepts, such as:

-   ```Variables and Data Types``` Learn how variables are used to store and manage data, such as the target number and the user's guesses.
-   ```Input and Output``` Understand how to take user input (guesses) and provide output (clues) based on the game's logic.
-   ```Conditional Statements``` Discover how to use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control the flow of the program and provide feedback to the user based on their guesses.
-   ```Loops``` Explore the usage of loops (for or while) to implement the limited number of chances for the user to guess the correct number.
-   ```Random Number Generation``` Learn how to generate random numbers, which is essential for setting up the target number in the game.

#### Instructions
1. Check your Python version by typing python --version in terminal/cmd prompt. If version is python 3.x you can continue. If version is python 2.x, try: python3 --version. If you receive a version replace 'python' with 'python3' for the rest of these instructions below.

2. Start the game: type python(3) pyGuess.py

3. The game will run in the terminal. Answer the first question - your name. Select (X) Start the game (Q) Exit.

4. The player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10.
   
5. The player will be informed if their input is out of bounds
   
6. The player is given 5 guesses for every number, once out of guesses the player has lost

```end```

### pyRockPaperScissors
RPS against your PC üêç

#### Overview
The pyRockPaperScissorsGame is a straightforward Python program that implements a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This game offers a fun and interactive way for users to play against the computer. The code is designed to be beginner-friendly and serves as a hands-on learning experience for fundamental Python concepts.

#### Concepts
By exploring the code for the pyRockPaperScissorsGame, beginners can familiarize themselves with key Python concepts, including:

-   ```Input and Output``` Learn how to use `input()` for user interaction and `print()` for displaying messages.
-   ```Conditional Statements``` Understand how to use if-elif-else statements to make decisions based on user input and generate game outcomes.
-   ```Lists and Randomization``` Explore the use of lists for storing game choices (rock, paper, scissors) and the `random` module to generate a random computer answer.
-   ```Looping``` See how a while loop is utilized to allow users to play the game multiple times.

#### Brief
1. **Introduction:**
   - The game starts with an engaging introduction where "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors" are gradually revealed.
   - Players are prompted to enter their name.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players are given the option to start or exit the game by typing 'Y' or 'X'.
   - The computer randomly selects its answer (rock, paper, or scissors), and players are asked to input their choice.

3. **Validating User Input:**
   - The code ensures that user input is valid (rock, paper, or scissors) and prompts the user to re-enter if necessary.

4. **Outcome Verdicts:**
   - The game determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's random answer.
   - Points are awarded for winning rounds, and the player is informed of the result.

5. **Play Again:**
   - After each round, players have the option to play again by typing 'Y' or exit the game by typing 'X'.

6. **Scoring:**
   - The player's total points are displayed at the end of the game.

#### Instructions
1. Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Type 'Y' to start the game or 'X' to exit.
4. Enter your name and make your choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
5. The computer will randomly select its answer, and the game will determine the winner.
6. After each round, decide whether to play again by typing 'Y' or exit the game by typing 'X'.
7. The total points earned will be displayed at the end of the game.

```end```
